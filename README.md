Assignment Descriptions

ASSIGMENT 1
In this assignment you have to create: i) a document (e.g. doc, word, etc), and ii) a
github repository.
In the document you need to
describe 2 possible strategies to play the Matching Pennies Game.
include a discussion as to whether they include "cognitive constraints", that is, for instance, a
discussion of memory limits and their impact on the strategy, or other important cognitive
science driven considerations.
report the formalization of these strategies, that is, a diagram and/or lines of code
implementing the strategy.
include plots of how the strategies fare against each other (or other baselines), according to
the instructions for the class in Week 3, and a very brief discussion of what the plots allow you
to understand.
include a link to the github repository
The github repository has to be linked in the document, and has to include all the code
for the strategy implementation, simulation of agents playing with those strategies and
visualization of the plots.
