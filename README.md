## Assignment Descriptions

#### ASSIGMENT 1
In this assignment you have to create: i) a document (e.g. doc, word, etc), and ii) a
github repository.

In the document you need to
* describe 2 possible strategies to play the Matching Pennies Game.
* include a discussion as to whether they include "cognitive constraints", that is, for instance, a
discussion of memory limits and their impact on the strategy, or other important cognitive
science driven considerations.
* report the formalization of these strategies, that is, a diagram and/or lines of code
implementing the strategy.
* include plots of how the strategies fare against each other (or other baselines), according to
the instructions for the class in Week 3, and a very brief discussion of what the plots allow you
to understand.
* include a link to the github repository

The github repository has to be linked in the document, and has to include all the code
for the strategy implementation, simulation of agents playing with those strategies and
visualization of the plots.


#### ASSIGNMENT 2
In the assignment you need to produce a text (+ plots) document (linked to a github repo) in which you:
* describe the models you are working on (you can re-use text from assignment 1, if relevant, it is no plagiarism!)
* showcase a commented version of the stan model (what does each line do?)
* describe a process of parameter recovery (why are you doing it?, how are you doing it?)
* discuss the results: how many trials should be used at least to properly recover the parameters? What’s the role of priors? Add relevant plot(s).
